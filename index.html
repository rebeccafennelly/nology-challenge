        <h2 id="About"> About Rebecca </h2><br><br>
        <img class="bexinshanghai" src="images/bexinshanghai.jpeg" alt= "Rebecca standing in front of a view of The Bund, Shanghai.">
      
            <p id="p1"> Rebecca is a kind and conscientious family girl from Essex, always welcoming opportunities to meet new people and curious to learn about the lives and interests of others. After people, her first true love is food and wine, followed by a close and fortunate juxtaposition of dance and fitness. A good counter balance! Maintaining a healthy mind and body is of upmost importance to Rebecca, so early morning coastal walks accompanied by a podcast is her ideal start to the day - shortly followed by a black Americano!<br> <br>Travelling is one of Rebecca's biggest interests and diving into new cultures is something she embraces. Whether it's hiking in a Hong Kong typhoon or eating bugs in the Australian Outback, Rebecca isn't shy of trying new things and loves a challenge.</p>
   

    <h2 id="Career"> Career </h2>
    <img class="stairway" src= "images/stairway.jpeg" alt= "Rebecca in An American in Paris musical">

    <p id="p2"> Rebecca obtained a first class degree in Professional Dance and Musical Theatre from Bird College (2010-2013). From graduation, she dived head first into the word of theatre, film and TV and over the last seven years, has reached a real sense of satisfaction in that industry. As a professional dancer, singer and actress, she has achieved the goals that she set herself as an ambitious young person. Rebecca feels so lucky to have professionally performed various roles in various shows in the West End and touring productions - something her 13 year old self could only dream of. As a keen learner and eager goal setter, Rebecca is ready to embark on a new adventure. And what world is more similar to theatre than the tech world…right!? <br><br> <span>Why Web Dev?</span><br><br> Web development was something that came to Rebecca's attention when researching a career change. The prospects a career in tech present, seem very promising, and the idea of working remotely, in order to facilitate further travel opportunities, particularly excites Rebecca. Being able to combine her creative streak with cognitively challenging work is really an ideal career for her and so she is very ready to give this course her best shot!</p>
